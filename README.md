# Configs
Configs are the things that allow you to change your winfetch logo and text colors.

If you want to use other peoples config, go to [here](https://github.com/iamfrojy/winfetch/tree/main/configs) to find them.

To edit your config go to C:\winfetch\ and edit the .ps1 winfetch file.
If you want to edit the logo find the "$logo = @(" string.
Then place you ascii with each line of the ascii a seperate string in the array, with each string being in double quotes, and lines seperated with commas.

If you just want to use someone elses config, go into the same winfetch .ps1 file and replace the code with the (name)config.ps1 file.
